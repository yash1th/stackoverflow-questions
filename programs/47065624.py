# Initialize a list to be an empty list (this list will store the test scores we will read from the file)
# Ask the user for a file name and open the file for reading
# For each line in the file
# Convert the test score in the current line to a number (since we need numeric data)
# Add the test score to the list (either using append or insert, up to you)
# Close the file
# Sort the list using the built in python function sort 
# if the list length is odd 
# median gets assigned the middle value of that sequence (i.e., the element at position list_length divided by 2)
# otherwise
# val1 gets the value at index list_length divided by 2 
# val2 gets the value at index list_length divided by 2 â€“ 1 
# median gets assigned the average of val1 and val2 (i.e., val1 + val2 / 2)
# print the median to the shell (not to a file)
